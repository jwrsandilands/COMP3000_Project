# COMP3000_Project
This is the repository for my final year uni project.

### Project Title
R.C. Rumble!

### Project Vision
For parties or groups of any age whose desire is to compete in a fun, inclusive and casual experience. The "RC Rumble" app is a competitive multiplayer PVP arcade game built in Unity(C#) to run on large tablet devices that offers unique top-down car control gameplay, due to the nature of the device the game is built for. The gameplay is similar to games like "Rocket League", and to an extent other arcade classics like "Air Hockey", but will have a focus on crazy environments that implement obstacles and party game-esque mechanics.

### Supervisor
Marius Varga

### Details
This project is built in Unity 2021.1.17f1, and its stability cannot be garunteed in other versions. The game has two scenes, both in the scenes folder, being the game menu and game arena. For the game arena to actually function like a game, it is necessary that it is entered during play from the game menu.

The file structure is self-explinatory and game assets are kept in their respective folders. Additionally, Test Scripts are kept in the "Test Scripts" folder, however some of the scripts in this folder are still used, IE: "PortalWall.cs".

All assets in the game are made by mystelf, or are Unity default and not extenal assets were used.

### Running the Game 
To run the game in the editor, simply start playing from the main menu and connect two controllers by pressing L and R on connected XInput devices (IE: Microsoft controller) 

You will need two controllers as there is no other way to experience the gameplay past the main menu, without editing the code. It is also possible editing the code to allow access to the game without two controllers may cause errors.

If the menus appear not to work using a controller, use a mouse instead as that input is always recognised.
