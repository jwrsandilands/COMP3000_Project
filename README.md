# COMP3000_Project
This is the repository for my final year uni project.

# Project Title
Blast Hockey

# Project Vision
For parties or groups of any age whose desire is to compete in a fun, inclusive and casual experience. 
The “Blast hockey” app is a competitive multiplayer arcade game built in Unity(C#) to run on large tablet devices that offers unique building/destruction mechanics in addition to gameplay similar to classic arcade games like “Air Hockey” and “Breakout” in order to put a fun twist on established conventions.
